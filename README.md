# RGB Color Mixer

A simple, beginner-friendly web application that lets you experiment with RGB colors using sliders. Move the sliders to adjust the red, green, and blue color components, and see the resulting color and its RGB value in real-time.

## Features
- Dynamically change the color using sliders for red, green, and blue.
- See the current RGB value displayed as text.
- Fully interactive and responsive interface.

## How It Works
1. Each slider represents one component of an RGB color (Red, Green, Blue).
2. Adjust the sliders to set the intensity of each color (values range from 0 to 255).
3. The combined RGB value is displayed in a preview box with the current color and its RGB code.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the elements.
- **JavaScript**: For making the sliders interactive and updating the color dynamically.
